## Problem

Our hero Teemo is attacking an enemy Ashe with poison attacks! When Teemo attacks Ashe, Ashe gets poisoned for a exactly `duration` seconds. More formally, an attack at second `t` will mean Ashe is poisoned during the **inclusive** time interval `[t, t + duration - 1]`. If Teemo attacks again **before** the poison effect ends, the timer for it is **reset** , and the poison effect will end `duration` seconds after the new attack.

You are given a **non-decreasing** integer array `timeSeries`, where `timeSeries[i]` denotes that Teemo attacks Ashe at second `timeSeries[i]`, and an integer `duration`.

Return _the**total** number of seconds that Ashe is poisoned_.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** timeSeries = [1,4], duration = 2
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:
    - At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.
    - At second 4, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 4 and 5.
    Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, 4, and 5, which is 4 seconds in total.
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** timeSeries = [1,2], duration = 2
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:
    - At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.
    - At second 2 however, Teemo attacks again and resets the poison timer. Ashe is poisoned for seconds 2 and 3.
    Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, and 3, which is 3 seconds in total.

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= timeSeries.length <= 104`
  * `0 <= timeSeries[i], duration <= 107`
  * `timeSeries` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int findPoisonedDuration(int[] timeSeries, int duration) {
        int total = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < timeSeries.length-1; i++) {
            // if next attack occurs before current duration ends, include the difference
            if (timeSeries[i+1] <= timeSeries[i] + duration-1) {
                total += timeSeries[i+1] - timeSeries[i];
            } else { // add duration normally
                total += duration;
            }
        }
        total += duration; // include last attack from teemo
        return total;
    }
}
```
