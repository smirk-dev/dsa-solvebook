## Problem

You are given an array `target` of n integers. From a starting array `arr` consisting of `n` 1's, you may perform the following procedure :

  * let `x` be the sum of all elements currently in your array.
  * choose index `i`, such that `0 <= i < n` and set the value of `arr` at index `i` to `x`.
  * You may repeat this procedure as many times as needed.



Return `true` _if it is possible to construct the_ `target` _array from_ `arr` _, otherwise, return_ `false`.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** target = [9,3,5]
    **Output:** true
    **Explanation:** Start with arr = [1, 1, 1] 
    [1, 1, 1], sum = 3 choose index 1
    [1, 3, 1], sum = 5 choose index 2
    [1, 3, 5], sum = 9 choose index 0
    [9, 3, 5] Done
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** target = [1,1,1,2]
    **Output:** false
    **Explanation:** Impossible to create target array from [1,1,1,1].
    

**Example 3:**
    
    
    **Input:** target = [8,5]
    **Output:** true
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `n == target.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 5 * 104`
  * `1 <= target[i] <= 109`

## Solution

```python
import heapq
class Solution:
    def isPossible(self, target: List[int]) -> bool:
        total = sum(target)
        target = [-x for x in target]
        heapq.heapify(target)
        
        while True:
            largest = -heapq.heappop(target)
            rest = total - largest
            if largest == 1 or rest == 1:
                return True
            if rest == 0 or largest < rest or largest % rest == 0:
                return False
            new_val = largest % rest
            total = rest + new_val
            heapq.heappush(target, -new_val)
```
