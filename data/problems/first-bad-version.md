## Problem

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** n = 5, bad = 4
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:**
    call isBadVersion(3) -> false
    call isBadVersion(5) -> true
    call isBadVersion(4) -> true
    Then 4 is the first bad version.
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** n = 1, bad = 1
    **Output:** 1
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= bad <= n <= 231 - 1`

## Solution

```java
/* The isBadVersion API is defined in the parent class VersionControl.
      boolean isBadVersion(int version); */

public class Solution extends VersionControl {
    public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int low = 1;
        int high = n;

        while(low < high){
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if(isBadVersion(mid)){
                high = mid;
            }
            else{
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return low;        
    }
}
```
