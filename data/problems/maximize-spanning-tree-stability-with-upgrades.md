## Problem

You are given an integer `n`, representing `n` nodes numbered from 0 to `n - 1` and a list of `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, si, musti]`:

  * `ui` and `vi` indicates an undirected edge between nodes `ui` and `vi`.
  * `si` is the strength of the edge.
  * `musti` is an integer (0 or 1). If `musti == 1`, the edge **must** be included in the******spanning tree**. These edges **cannot** be **upgraded**.



You are also given an integer `k`, the **maximum** number of upgrades you can perform. Each upgrade **doubles** the strength of an edge, and each eligible edge (with `musti == 0`) can be upgraded **at most** once.

The **stability** of a spanning tree is defined as the **minimum** strength score among all edges included in it.

Return the **maximum** possible stability of any valid spanning tree. If it is impossible to connect all nodes, return `-1`.

**Note** : A **spanning tree** of a graph with `n` nodes is a subset of the edges that connects all nodes together (i.e. the graph is **connected**) _without_ forming any cycles, and uses **exactly** `n - 1` edges.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1,2,1],[1,2,3,0]], k = 1

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

  * Edge `[0,1]` with strength = 2 must be included in the spanning tree.
  * Edge `[1,2]` is optional and can be upgraded from 3 to 6 using one upgrade.
  * The resulting spanning tree includes these two edges with strengths 2 and 6.
  * The minimum strength in the spanning tree is 2, which is the maximum possible stability.



**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1,4,0],[1,2,3,0],[0,2,1,0]], k = 2

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

  * Since all edges are optional and up to `k = 2` upgrades are allowed.
  * Upgrade edges `[0,1]` from 4 to 8 and `[1,2]` from 3 to 6.
  * The resulting spanning tree includes these two edges with strengths 8 and 6.
  * The minimum strength in the tree is 6, which is the maximum possible stability.



**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1,1,1],[1,2,1,1],[2,0,1,1]], k = 0

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:**

  * All edges are mandatory and form a cycle, which violates the spanning tree property of acyclicity. Thus, the answer is -1.



 

**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= n <= 105`
  * `1 <= edges.length <= 105`
  * `edges[i] = [ui, vi, si, musti]`
  * `0 <= ui, vi < n`
  * `ui != vi`
  * `1 <= si <= 105`
  * `musti` is either `0` or `1`.
  * `0 <= k <= n`
  * There are no duplicate edges.

## Solution

```java
class DSU {
    int[] parent;
    int[] rank;
    int components;

    public DSU(int n) {
        parent = new int[n];
        rank = new int[n];
        components = n;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            parent[i] = i;
        }
    }

    public int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x) {
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        }
        return parent[x];
    }

    public boolean unite(int a, int b) {
        int pa = find(a);
        int pb = find(b);

        if (pa == pb) return false;

        if (rank[pa] < rank[pb]) {
            int temp = pa;
            pa = pb;

        }

        parent[pb] = pa;

        if (rank[pa] == rank[pb]) {
            rank[pa]++;
        }

        components--;
        return true;
