## Problem

You are given a 2D integer array `squares`. Each `squares[i] = [xi, yi, li]` represents the coordinates of the bottom-left point and the side length of a square parallel to the x-axis.

Find the **minimum** y-coordinate value of a horizontal line such that the total area covered by squares above the line _equals_ the total area covered by squares below the line.

Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.

**Note** : Squares **may** overlap. Overlapping areas should be counted **only once** in this version.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** squares = [[0,0,1],[2,2,1]]

**Output:** 1.00000

**Explanation:**

Any horizontal line between `y = 1` and `y = 2` results in an equal split, with 1 square unit above and 1 square unit below. The minimum y-value is 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** squares = [[0,0,2],[1,1,1]]

**Output:** 1.00000

**Explanation:**

Since the blue square overlaps with the red square, it will not be counted again. Thus, the line `y = 1` splits the squares into two equal parts.

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= squares.length <= 5 * 104`
  * `squares[i] = [xi, yi, li]`
  * `squares[i].length == 3`
  * `0 <= xi, yi <= 109`
  * `1 <= li <= 109`
  * The total area of all the squares will not exceed `1015`.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def separateSquares(self, squares: List[List[int]]) -> float:
        events = []
        for x, y, l in squares:
            events.append((y, 1, x, x + l))
            events.append((y + l, -1, x, x + l))

        events.sort()
        xs = []
        prev_y = events[0][0]
        total = 0
        areas = []

        def union_len(intervals):
            intervals.sort()
            res = cur = 0
            end = -10**30
            for a, b in intervals:
                if a > end:
                    res += b - a
                    end = b
                elif b > end:
                    res += b - end
                    end = b
            return res

        for y, typ, x1, x2 in events:
            if y > prev_y and xs:
                h = y - prev_y
                w = union_len(xs)
                areas.append((prev_y, h, w))
                total += h * w
            if typ == 1:
                xs.append((x1, x2))
            else:
                xs.remove((x1, x2))
            prev_y = y

        half = total / 2
        acc = 0
        for y, h, w in areas:
            if acc + h * w >= half:
                return y + (half - acc) / w
            acc += h * w

        return 0.0
```
