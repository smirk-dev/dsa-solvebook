## Problem

You are given the two integers, `n` and `m` and two integer arrays, `hBars` and `vBars`. The grid has `n + 2` horizontal and `m + 2` vertical bars, creating 1 x 1 unit cells. The bars are indexed starting from `1`.

You can **remove** some of the bars in `hBars` from horizontal bars and some of the bars in `vBars` from vertical bars. Note that other bars are fixed and cannot be removed.

Return an integer denoting the **maximum area** of a _square-shaped_ hole in the grid, after removing some bars (possibly none).

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2, m = 1, hBars = [2,3], vBars = [2]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

The left image shows the initial grid formed by the bars. The horizontal bars are `[1,2,3,4]`, and the vertical bars are `[1,2,3]`.

One way to get the maximum square-shaped hole is by removing horizontal bar 2 and vertical bar 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1, m = 1, hBars = [2], vBars = [2]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

To get the maximum square-shaped hole, we remove horizontal bar 2 and vertical bar 2.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 2, m = 3, hBars = [2,3], vBars = [2,4]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

One way to get the maximum square-shaped hole is by removing horizontal bar 3, and vertical bar 4.

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 109`
  * `1 <= m <= 109`
  * `1 <= hBars.length <= 100`
  * `2 <= hBars[i] <= n + 1`
  * `1 <= vBars.length <= 100`
  * `2 <= vBars[i] <= m + 1`
  * All values in `hBars` are distinct.
  * All values in `vBars` are distinct.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maximizeSquareHoleArea(self, n: int, m: int, hBars: List[int], vBars: List[int]) -> int:
        hBars.sort()
        vBars.sort()

        maxiH, maxiV, maxi = 1, 1, 1

        for i in range(1, len(hBars)):
            if hBars[i] - hBars[i-1] == 1:
                maxi += 1
            else:
                maxiH = max(maxiH, maxi)
                maxi = 1
        maxiH = max(maxiH, maxi)

        maxi = 1
        for i in range(1, len(vBars)):
            if vBars[i] - vBars[i-1] == 1:
                maxi += 1
            else:
                maxiV = max(maxiV, maxi)
                maxi = 1
        maxiV = max(maxiV, maxi)

        side = min(maxiH+1, maxiV+1)
        return side * side
```
