## Problem

Given a**  directed acyclic graph**, with `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n-1`, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [fromi, toi]` represents a directed edge from node `fromi` to node `toi`.

Find _the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable_. It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.

Notice that you can return the vertices in any order.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,5],[3,4],[4,2]]
    **Output:** [0,3]
    **Explanation:** It's not possible to reach all the nodes from a single vertex. From 0 we can reach [0,1,2,5]. From 3 we can reach [3,4,2,5]. So we output [0,3].

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[2,1],[3,1],[1,4],[2,4]]
    **Output:** [0,2,3]
    **Explanation:** Notice that vertices 0, 3 and 2 are not reachable from any other node, so we must include them. Also any of these vertices can reach nodes 1 and 4.
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= n <= 10^5`
  * `1 <= edges.length <= min(10^5, n * (n - 1) / 2)`
  * `edges[i].length == 2`
  * `0 <= fromi, toi < n`
  * All pairs `(fromi, toi)` are distinct.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def findSmallestSetOfVertices(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        in_deg = [0] * n
        for u, v in edges:
            in_deg[v] += 1
        return [i for i in range(n) if in_deg[i] == 0]
```

_Add your notes here — why did you choose this approach? What's the time/space complexity?_
