## Problem

Given a string `s` consisting of words and spaces, return _the length of the**last** word in the string._

A **word** is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** s = "Hello World"
    **Output:** 5
    **Explanation:** The last word is "World" with length 5.
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** The last word is "moon" with length 4.
    

**Example 3:**
    
    
    **Input:** s = "luffy is still joyboy"
    **Output:** 6
    **Explanation:** The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 104`
  * `s` consists of only English letters and spaces `' '`.
  * There will be at least one word in `s`.

## Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s):
        end = len(s) - 1

        while s[end] == " ":
            end -= 1
        
        start = end
        while start >= 0 and s[start] != " ":
            start -= 1
        
        return end - start
```
