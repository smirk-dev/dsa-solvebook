## Problem

You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a **triple booking**.

A **triple booking** happens when three events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to all the three events.).

The event can be represented as a pair of integers `startTime` and `endTime` that represents a booking on the half-open interval `[startTime, endTime)`, the range of real numbers `x` such that `startTime <= x < endTime`.

Implement the `MyCalendarTwo` class:

  * `MyCalendarTwo()` Initializes the calendar object.
  * `boolean book(int startTime, int endTime)` Returns `true` if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a **triple booking**. Otherwise, return `false` and do not add the event to the calendar.



 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input**
    ["MyCalendarTwo", "book", "book", "book", "book", "book", "book"]
    [[], [10, 20], [50, 60], [10, 40], [5, 15], [5, 10], [25, 55]]
    **Output**
    [null, true, true, true, false, true, true]
    
    **Explanation**
    MyCalendarTwo myCalendarTwo = new MyCalendarTwo();
    myCalendarTwo.book(10, 20); // return True, The event can be booked. 
    myCalendarTwo.book(50, 60); // return True, The event can be booked. 
    myCalendarTwo.book(10, 40); // return True, The event can be double booked. 
    myCalendarTwo.book(5, 15);  // return False, The event cannot be booked, because it would result in a triple booking.
    myCalendarTwo.book(5, 10); // return True, The event can be booked, as it does not use time 10 which is already double booked.
    myCalendarTwo.book(25, 55); // return True, The event can be booked, as the time in [25, 40) will be double booked with the third event, the time [40, 50) will be single booked, and the time [50, 55) will be double booked with the second event.
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= start < end <= 109`
  * At most `1000` calls will be made to `book`.

## Solution

```python
class MyCalendarTwo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.booked = []  # List of [start, end) of all events
        self.overlaps = []  # List of [start, end) of double booked segments

    def book(self, start: int, end: int) -> bool:
        # Check for triple booking
        for o_start, o_end in self.overlaps:
            if max(start, o_start) < min(end, o_end):  # overlap with a double-booked interval
                return False

        # Add double-booking to overlaps
        for b_start, b_end in self.booked:
            if max(start, b_start) < min(end, b_end):  # overlap found
                overlap_start = max(start, b_start)
                overlap_end = min(end, b_end)
                self.overlaps.append([overlap_start, overlap_end])

        # All good, book the event
        self.booked.append([start, end])
        return True
```
