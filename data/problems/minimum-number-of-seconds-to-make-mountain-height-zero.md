## Problem

You are given an integer `mountainHeight` denoting the height of a mountain.

You are also given an integer array `workerTimes` representing the work time of workers in **seconds**.

The workers work **simultaneously** to **reduce** the height of the mountain. For worker `i`:

  * To decrease the mountain's height by `x`, it takes `workerTimes[i] + workerTimes[i] * 2 + ... + workerTimes[i] * x` seconds. For example: 
    * To reduce the height of the mountain by 1, it takes `workerTimes[i]` seconds.
    * To reduce the height of the mountain by 2, it takes `workerTimes[i] + workerTimes[i] * 2` seconds, and so on.



Return an integer representing the **minimum** number of seconds required for the workers to make the height of the mountain 0.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** mountainHeight = 4, workerTimes = [2,1,1]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

One way the height of the mountain can be reduced to 0 is:

  * Worker 0 reduces the height by 1, taking `workerTimes[0] = 2` seconds.
  * Worker 1 reduces the height by 2, taking `workerTimes[1] + workerTimes[1] * 2 = 3` seconds.
  * Worker 2 reduces the height by 1, taking `workerTimes[2] = 1` second.



Since they work simultaneously, the minimum time needed is `max(2, 3, 1) = 3` seconds.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** mountainHeight = 10, workerTimes = [3,2,2,4]

**Output:** 12

**Explanation:**

  * Worker 0 reduces the height by 2, taking `workerTimes[0] + workerTimes[0] * 2 = 9` seconds.
  * Worker 1 reduces the height by 3, taking `workerTimes[1] + workerTimes[1] * 2 + workerTimes[1] * 3 = 12` seconds.
  * Worker 2 reduces the height by 3, taking `workerTimes[2] + workerTimes[2] * 2 + workerTimes[2] * 3 = 12` seconds.
  * Worker 3 reduces the height by 2, taking `workerTimes[3] + workerTimes[3] * 2 = 12` seconds.



The number of seconds needed is `max(9, 12, 12, 12) = 12` seconds.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** mountainHeight = 5, workerTimes = [1]

**Output:** 15

**Explanation:**

There is only one worker in this example, so the answer is `workerTimes[0] + workerTimes[0] * 2 + workerTimes[0] * 3 + workerTimes[0] * 4 + workerTimes[0] * 5 = 15`.

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= mountainHeight <= 105`
  * `1 <= workerTimes.length <= 104`
  * `1 <= workerTimes[i] <= 106`

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public long minNumberOfSeconds(int mountainHeight, int[] workerTimes) {
        long maxTime = 0;
        for (int t : workerTimes)
            maxTime = Math.max(maxTime, t);
        long lo = 1, hi = maxTime * (long) mountainHeight * (mountainHeight + 1) / 2;
        long res = hi;

        while (lo <= hi) {
            long mid = lo + ((hi - lo) >> 1);
            long sum = 0;

            for (int i = 0; i < workerTimes.length && sum < mountainHeight; i++)
                sum += (long) (Math.sqrt((double) mid / workerTimes[i] * 2 + 0.25) - 0.5);

            if (sum >= mountainHeight) {
                res = mid;
                hi = mid - 1;
            } else
                lo = mid + 1;
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```
