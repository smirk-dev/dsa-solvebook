## Problem

Given the array `nums`, for each `nums[i]` find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each `nums[i]` you have to count the number of valid `j's` such that `j != i` **and** `nums[j] < nums[i]`.

Return the answer in an array.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** nums = [8,1,2,2,3]
    **Output:** [4,0,1,1,3]
    **Explanation:** 
    For nums[0]=8 there exist four smaller numbers than it (1, 2, 2 and 3). 
    For nums[1]=1 does not exist any smaller number than it.
    For nums[2]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
    For nums[3]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
    For nums[4]=3 there exist three smaller numbers than it (1, 2 and 2).
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** nums = [6,5,4,8]
    **Output:** [2,1,0,3]
    

**Example 3:**
    
    
    **Input:** nums = [7,7,7,7]
    **Output:** [0,0,0,0]
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= nums.length <= 500`
  * `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def smallerNumbersThanCurrent(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        sorted_nums = sorted(nums)
        ranks = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(sorted_nums):
            if num not in ranks:
                ranks[num] = i
        return [ranks[num] for num in nums]
```
