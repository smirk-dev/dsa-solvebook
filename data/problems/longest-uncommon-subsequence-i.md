## Problem

Given two strings `a` and `b`, return _the length of the**longest uncommon subsequence** between _`a` _and_ `b`. _If no such uncommon subsequence exists, return_ `-1` _._

An **uncommon subsequence** between two strings is a string that is a **subsequence of exactly one of them**.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** a = "aba", b = "cdc"
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** One longest uncommon subsequence is "aba" because "aba" is a subsequence of "aba" but not "cdc".
    Note that "cdc" is also a longest uncommon subsequence.
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** a = "aaa", b = "bbb"
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:**  The longest uncommon subsequences are "aaa" and "bbb".
    

**Example 3:**
    
    
    **Input:** a = "aaa", b = "aaa"
    **Output:** -1
    **Explanation:**  Every subsequence of string a is also a subsequence of string b. Similarly, every subsequence of string b is also a subsequence of string a. So the answer would be -1.
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 100`
  * `a` and `b` consist of lower-case English letters.

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int findLUSlength(String a, String b) {
        if (a.equals(b)) return -1;
        return Math.max(a.length(), b.length());
    }
}
```
