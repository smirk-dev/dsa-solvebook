## Problem

You are given an array `bulbs` of integers between 1 and 100.

There are 100 light bulbs numbered from 1 to 100. All of them are switched off initially.

For each element `bulbs[i]` in the array `bulbs`:

  * If the `bulbs[i]th` light bulb is currently off, switch it on.
  * Otherwise, switch it off.



Return the list of integers denoting the light bulbs that are on in the end, **sorted** in **ascending** order. If no bulb is on, return an empty list.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** bulbs = [10,30,20,10]

**Output:** [20,30]

**Explanation:**

  * The `bulbs[0] = 10th` light bulb is currently off. We switch it on.
  * The `bulbs[1] = 30th` light bulb is currently off. We switch it on.
  * The `bulbs[2] = 20th` light bulb is currently off. We switch it on.
  * The `bulbs[3] = 10th` light bulb is currently on. We switch it off.
  * In the end, the 20th and the 30th light bulbs are on.



**Example 2:**

**Input:** bulbs = [100,100]

**Output:** []

**Explanation:**

  * The `bulbs[0] = 100th` light bulb is currently off. We switch it on.
  * The `bulbs[1] = 100th` light bulb is currently on. We switch it off.
  * In the end, no light bulb is on.



 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= bulbs.length <= 100`
  * `1 <= bulbs[i] <= 100`

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> toggleLightBulbs(List<Integer> bulbs) {
       
        boolean[] on = new boolean[101]; 
        
        for (int b : bulbs) {
            on[b] = !on[b];
        }
        
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
            if (on[i]) {
                result.add(i);
            }
        }
    
        return result;
    }
}
```
