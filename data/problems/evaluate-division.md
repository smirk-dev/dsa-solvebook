## Problem

You are given an array of variable pairs `equations` and an array of real numbers `values`, where `equations[i] = [Ai, Bi]` and `values[i]` represent the equation `Ai / Bi = values[i]`. Each `Ai` or `Bi` is a string that represents a single variable.

You are also given some `queries`, where `queries[j] = [Cj, Dj]` represents the `jth` query where you must find the answer for `Cj / Dj = ?`.

Return _the answers to all queries_. If a single answer cannot be determined, return `-1.0`.

**Note:** The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will not result in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.

**Note:  **The variables that do not occur in the list of equations are undefined, so the answer cannot be determined for them.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]], values = [2.0,3.0], queries = [["a","c"],["b","a"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"]]
    **Output:** [6.00000,0.50000,-1.00000,1.00000,-1.00000]
    **Explanation:** 
    Given: _a / b = 2.0_ , _b / c = 3.0_
    queries are: _a / c = ?_ , _b / a = ?_ , _a / e = ?_ , _a / a = ?_ , _x / x = ?_
    return: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ]
    note: x is undefined => -1.0

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"],["bc","cd"]], values = [1.5,2.5,5.0], queries = [["a","c"],["c","b"],["bc","cd"],["cd","bc"]]
    **Output:** [3.75000,0.40000,5.00000,0.20000]
    

**Example 3:**
    
    
    **Input:** equations = [["a","b"]], values = [0.5], queries = [["a","b"],["b","a"],["a","c"],["x","y"]]
    **Output:** [0.50000,2.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000]
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= equations.length <= 20`
  * `equations[i].length == 2`
  * `1 <= Ai.length, Bi.length <= 5`
  * `values.length == equations.length`
  * `0.0 < values[i] <= 20.0`
  * `1 <= queries.length <= 20`
  * `queries[i].length == 2`
  * `1 <= Cj.length, Dj.length <= 5`
  * `Ai, Bi, Cj, Dj` consist of lower case English letters and digits.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def calcEquation(self, equations: List[List[str]], values: List[float], queries: List[List[str]]) -> List[float]:
        graph = {}
        for (a, b), value in zip(equations, values):
            if a not in graph:
                graph[a] = {}
            if b not in graph:
                graph[b] = {}
            graph[a][b] = value
            graph[b][a] = 1 / value
        def dfs(start, end, visited):
            if start not in graph or end not in graph:
                return -1.0
            if start == end:
                return 1.0
            visited.add(start)
            for neighbor, value in graph[start].items():
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    result = dfs(neighbor, end, visited)
                    if result != -1.0:
                        return value * result
            return -1.0
        results = []
        for c, d in queries:
            results.append(dfs(c, d, set()))
        return results
```
