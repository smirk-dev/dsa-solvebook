## Problem

You are given an `m x n` matrix `grid` of positive integers. Your task is to determine if it is possible to make **either one horizontal or one vertical cut** on the grid such that:

  * Each of the two resulting sections formed by the cut is **non-empty**.
  * The sum of elements in both sections is **equal** , or can be made equal by discounting **at most** one single cell in total (from either section).
  * If a cell is discounted, the rest of the section must **remain connected**.



Return `true` if such a partition exists; otherwise, return `false`.

**Note:** A section is **connected** if every cell in it can be reached from any other cell by moving up, down, left, or right through other cells in the section.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,4],[2,3]]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:**

  * A horizontal cut after the first row gives sums `1 + 4 = 5` and `2 + 3 = 5`, which are equal. Thus, the answer is `true`.



**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,2],[3,4]]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:**

  * A vertical cut after the first column gives sums `1 + 3 = 4` and `2 + 4 = 6`.
  * By discounting 2 from the right section (`6 - 2 = 4`), both sections have equal sums and remain connected. Thus, the answer is `true`.



**Example 3:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,2,4],[2,3,5]]

**Output:** false

**Explanation:**

****

  * A horizontal cut after the first row gives `1 + 2 + 4 = 7` and `2 + 3 + 5 = 10`.
  * By discounting 3 from the bottom section (`10 - 3 = 7`), both sections have equal sums, but they do not remain connected as it splits the bottom section into two parts (`[2]` and `[5]`). Thus, the answer is `false`.



**Example 4:**

**Input:** grid = [[4,1,8],[3,2,6]]

**Output:** false

**Explanation:**

No valid cut exists, so the answer is `false`.

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= m == grid.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= n == grid[i].length <= 105`
  * `2 <= m * n <= 105`
  * `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 105`

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canPartitionGrid(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;

        long total = 0;

        HashMap<Long, Integer> right = new HashMap<>();

        // Initialize bottom and right maps
        for (int[] row : grid) {
            for (int x : row) {
                total += x;
                bottom.put((long)x, bottom.getOrDefault((long)x, 0) + 1);
                right.put((long)x, right.getOrDefault((long)x, 0) + 1);
            }
        }

        long sumTop = 0;

                sumTop += val;

                top.put((long)val, top.getOrDefault((long)val, 0) + 1);
                bottom.put((long)val, bottom.get((long)val) - 1);

            if (sumTop == sumBottom) return true;

            long diff = Math.abs(sumTop - sumBottom);

            } else {

                left.put((long)val, left.getOrDefault((long)val, 0) + 1);
                right.put((long)val, right.get((long)val) - 1);
            }

            long sumRight = total - sumLeft;

            if (sumLeft == sumRight) return true;

            long diff = Math.abs(sumLeft - sumRight);

            if (sumLeft > sumRight) {
                if (check(left, grid, 0, m - 1, 0, j, diff)) return true;
            } else {
                if (check(right, grid, 0, m - 1, j + 1, n - 1, diff)) return true;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }

    private boolean check(HashMap<Long, Integer> mp, int[][] grid,
                          int r1, int r2, int c1, int c2, long diff) {

        int rows = r2 - r1 + 1;
        int cols = c2 - c1 + 1;

        // single cell
        if (rows * cols == 1) return false;

        // 1D row
        if (rows == 1) {
            return grid[r1][c1] == diff || grid[r1][c2] == diff;
        }

        // 1D column
        if (cols == 1) {
            return grid[r1][c1] == diff || grid[r2][c1] == diff;
        }

        return mp.getOrDefault(diff, 0) > 0;
