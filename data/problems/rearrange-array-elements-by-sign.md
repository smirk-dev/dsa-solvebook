## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of **even** length consisting of an **equal** number of positive and negative integers.

You should return the array of nums such that the array follows the given conditions:

  1. Every **consecutive pair** of integers have **opposite signs**.
  2. For all integers with the same sign, the **order** in which they were present in `nums` is **preserved**.
  3. The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.



Return _the modified array after rearranging the elements to satisfy the aforementioned conditions_.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** nums = [3,1,-2,-5,2,-4]
    **Output:** [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4]
    **Explanation:**
    The positive integers in nums are [3,1,2]. The negative integers are [-2,-5,-4].
    The only possible way to rearrange them such that they satisfy all conditions is [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4].
    Other ways such as [1,-2,2,-5,3,-4], [3,1,2,-2,-5,-4], [-2,3,-5,1,-4,2] are incorrect because they do not satisfy one or more conditions.  
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** nums = [-1,1]
    **Output:** [1,-1]
    **Explanation:**
    1 is the only positive integer and -1 the only negative integer in nums.
    So nums is rearranged to [1,-1].
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 105`
  * `nums.length` is **even**
  * `1 <= |nums[i]| <= 105`
  * `nums` consists of **equal** number of positive and negative integers.



 

It is not required to do the modifications in-place.

## Solution

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int[] rearrangeArray(int[] nums) {
        List<Integer> v1 = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Integer> v2 = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num > 0) {
                v1.add(num);
            } else {
                v2.add(num);
            }
        }
        
        int ind1 = 0, ind2 = 0;
        
        while (ind2 < nums.length / 2) {
            ans.add(v1.get(ind1));
            ind1++;
            ans.add(v2.get(ind2));
            ind2++;
        }
        
        return ans.stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).toArray();
    }
}
```
