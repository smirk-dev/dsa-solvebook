## Problem

You are given a 2D **binary** array `grid`. Find a rectangle with horizontal and vertical sides with the**smallest** area, such that all the 1's in `grid` lie inside this rectangle.

Return the **minimum** possible area of the rectangle.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = [[0,1,0],[1,0,1]]

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

The smallest rectangle has a height of 2 and a width of 3, so it has an area of `2 * 3 = 6`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,0],[0,0]]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

The smallest rectangle has both height and width 1, so its area is `1 * 1 = 1`.

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= grid.length, grid[i].length <= 1000`
  * `grid[i][j]` is either 0 or 1.
  * The input is generated such that there is at least one 1 in `grid`.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumArea(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
        int minRow = m, maxRow = -1;
        int minCol = n, maxCol = -1;

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    minRow = min(minRow, i);
                    maxRow = max(maxRow, i);
                    minCol = min(minCol, j);
                    maxCol = max(maxCol, j);
                }
            }
        }
        return (maxRow - minRow + 1) * (maxCol - minCol + 1);
    }
};
```
