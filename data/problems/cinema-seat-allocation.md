## Problem

A cinema has `n` rows of seats, numbered from 1 to `n` and there are ten seats in each row, labelled from 1 to 10 as shown in the figure above.

Given the array `reservedSeats` containing the numbers of seats already reserved, for example, `reservedSeats[i] = [3,8]` means the seat located in row **3** and labelled with **8**  is already reserved.

_Return the maximum number of four-person groups  you can assign on the cinema seats._ A four-person group occupies four adjacent seats **in one single row**. Seats across an aisle (such as [3,3] and [3,4]) are not considered to be adjacent, but there is an exceptional case on which an aisle split a four-person group, in that case, the aisle split a four-person group in the middle, which means to have two people on each side.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** n = 3, reservedSeats = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,8],[2,6],[3,1],[3,10]]
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** The figure above shows the optimal allocation for four groups, where seats mark with blue are already reserved and contiguous seats mark with orange are for one group.
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** n = 2, reservedSeats = [[2,1],[1,8],[2,6]]
    **Output:** 2
    

**Example 3:**
    
    
    **Input:** n = 4, reservedSeats = [[4,3],[1,4],[4,6],[1,7]]
    **Output:** 4
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 10^9`
  * `1 <= reservedSeats.length <= min(10*n, 10^4)`
  * `reservedSeats[i].length == 2`
  * `1 <= reservedSeats[i][0] <= n`
  * `1 <= reservedSeats[i][1] <= 10`
  * All `reservedSeats[i]` are distinct.

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxNumberOfFamilies(int n, int[][] reservedSeats) {
        Map<Integer,List<Integer>> map = new HashMap<>();
        
        
        for(int[] i : reservedSeats){
            map.putIfAbsent(i[0],new ArrayList<>());
            map.get(i[0]).add(i[1]);
        }
        
        
        int ans = 2*(n - map.size());
        
        for(Map.Entry<Integer,List<Integer>> entry : map.entrySet()){
            List<Integer> seats = entry.getValue();
            
            boolean isLeftAisle = false, isRightAisle = false, isMiddle = false;
            
            for(int seat : seats){
                
                if(seat >= 2 && seat <= 5)
                    isLeftAisle = true;
                if(seat >= 6 && seat <= 9)
                    isRightAisle = true;
                if(seat >=4 && seat <= 7)
                    isMiddle = true;
                    
                if(isLeftAisle && isRightAisle && isMiddle){
                    break;
                }
            }
            
            if(!isLeftAisle)
                ans += 1;
            if(!isRightAisle)
                ans += 1;
            if(isLeftAisle && isRightAisle && !isMiddle)
                ans += 1;
            
        }
       
        return ans;
        
    }
}
```
