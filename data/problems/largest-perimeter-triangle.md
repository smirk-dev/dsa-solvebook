## Problem

Given an integer array `nums`, return _the largest perimeter of a triangle with a non-zero area, formed from three of these lengths_. If it is impossible to form any triangle of a non-zero area, return `0`.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** nums = [2,1,2]
    **Output:** 5
    **Explanation:** You can form a triangle with three side lengths: 1, 2, and 2.
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** nums = [1,2,1,10]
    **Output:** 0
    **Explanation:** 
    You cannot use the side lengths 1, 1, and 2 to form a triangle.
    You cannot use the side lengths 1, 1, and 10 to form a triangle.
    You cannot use the side lengths 1, 2, and 10 to form a triangle.
    As we cannot use any three side lengths to form a triangle of non-zero area, we return 0.
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `3 <= nums.length <= 104`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 106`

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int largestPerimeter(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end(), greater<int>());
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 2; i++)
            if (nums[i + 1] + nums[i + 2] > nums[i])
                return nums[i] + nums[i + 1] + nums[i + 2];
        return 0;
    }
};
```
