## Problem

You are given two **0-indexed** strings `source` and `target`, both of length `n` and consisting of **lowercase** English characters. You are also given two **0-indexed** string arrays `original` and `changed`, and an integer array `cost`, where `cost[i]` represents the cost of converting the string `original[i]` to the string `changed[i]`.

You start with the string `source`. In one operation, you can pick a **substring** `x` from the string, and change it to `y` at a cost of `z` **if** there exists **any** index `j` such that `cost[j] == z`, `original[j] == x`, and `changed[j] == y`. You are allowed to do **any** number of operations, but any pair of operations must satisfy **either** of these two conditions:

  * The substrings picked in the operations are `source[a..b]` and `source[c..d]` with either `b < c` **or** `d < a`. In other words, the indices picked in both operations are **disjoint**.
  * The substrings picked in the operations are `source[a..b]` and `source[c..d]` with `a == c` **and** `b == d`. In other words, the indices picked in both operations are **identical**.



Return _the**minimum** cost to convert the string _`source` _to the string_`target` _using**any** number of operations_. _If it is impossible to convert_ `source` _to_ `target`,_return_ `-1`.

**Note** that there may exist indices `i`, `j` such that `original[j] == original[i]` and `changed[j] == changed[i]`.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** source = "abcd", target = "acbe", original = ["a","b","c","c","e","d"], changed = ["b","c","b","e","b","e"], cost = [2,5,5,1,2,20]
    **Output:** 28
    **Explanation:** To convert "abcd" to "acbe", do the following operations:
    - Change substring source[1..1] from "b" to "c" at a cost of 5.
    - Change substring source[2..2] from "c" to "e" at a cost of 1.
    - Change substring source[2..2] from "e" to "b" at a cost of 2.
    - Change substring source[3..3] from "d" to "e" at a cost of 20.
    The total cost incurred is 5 + 1 + 2 + 20 = 28. 
    It can be shown that this is the minimum possible cost.
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** source = "abcdefgh", target = "acdeeghh", original = ["bcd","fgh","thh"], changed = ["cde","thh","ghh"], cost = [1,3,5]
    **Output:** 9
    **Explanation:** To convert "abcdefgh" to "acdeeghh", do the following operations:
    - Change substring source[1..3] from "bcd" to "cde" at a cost of 1.
    - Change substring source[5..7] from "fgh" to "thh" at a cost of 3. We can do this operation because indices [5,7] are disjoint with indices picked in the first operation.
    - Change substring source[5..7] from "thh" to "ghh" at a cost of 5. We can do this operation because indices [5,7] are disjoint with indices picked in the first operation, and identical with indices picked in the second operation.
    The total cost incurred is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.
    It can be shown that this is the minimum possible cost.
    

**Example 3:**
    
    
    **Input:** source = "abcdefgh", target = "addddddd", original = ["bcd","defgh"], changed = ["ddd","ddddd"], cost = [100,1578]
    **Output:** -1
    **Explanation:** It is impossible to convert "abcdefgh" to "addddddd".
    If you select substring source[1..3] as the first operation to change "abcdefgh" to "adddefgh", you cannot select substring source[3..7] as the second operation because it has a common index, 3, with the first operation.
    If you select substring source[3..7] as the first operation to change "abcdefgh" to "abcddddd", you cannot select substring source[1..3] as the second operation because it has a common index, 3, with the first operation.
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= source.length == target.length <= 1000`
  * `source`, `target` consist only of lowercase English characters.
  * `1 <= cost.length == original.length == changed.length <= 100`
  * `1 <= original[i].length == changed[i].length <= source.length`
  * `original[i]`, `changed[i]` consist only of lowercase English characters.
  * `original[i] != changed[i]`
  * `1 <= cost[i] <= 106`

        for (long[] row : dist) Arrays.fill(row, INF);

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            if (!id.containsKey(original[i])) {
                id.put(original[i], sz++);
                lens.add(original[i].length());
            }
            if (!id.containsKey(changed[i])) {

            }
            int u = id.get(original[i]);
            int v = id.get(changed[i]);
            dist[u][v] = Math.min(dist[u][v], cost[i]);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < sz; i++) dist[i][i] = 0;

        for (int k = 0; k < sz; k++)
            for (int i = 0; i < sz; i++)
                if (dist[i][k] != INF)
                    for (int j = 0; j < sz; j++)
                        if (dist[k][j] != INF)
                            dist[i][j] = Math.min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]);

        long[] dp = new long[n + 1];
        Arrays.fill(dp, INF);
        dp[0] = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (dp[i] == INF) continue;

            if (source.charAt(i) == target.charAt(i))
                dp[i + 1] = Math.min(dp[i + 1], dp[i]);

            for (int L : lens) {
                if (i + L > n) continue;

                String s = source.substring(i, i + L);
                String t = target.substring(i, i + L);

                if (id.containsKey(s) && id.containsKey(t)) {
                    long d = dist[id.get(s)][id.get(t)];
                    if (d != INF)
                        dp[i + L] = Math.min(dp[i + L], dp[i] + d);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[n] == INF ? -1 : dp[n];
    }
}
