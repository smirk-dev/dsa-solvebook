## Problem

DataFrame weather
    +-------------+--------+
    | Column Name | Type   |
    +-------------+--------+
    | city        | object |
    | month       | object |
    | temperature | int    |
    +-------------+--------+
    

Write a solution to **pivot** the data so that each row represents temperatures for a specific month, and each city is a separate column.

The result format is in the following example.

 
    
    
    **Example 1:**
    **Input:**
    +--------------+----------+-------------+
    | city         | month    | temperature |
    +--------------+----------+-------------+
    | Jacksonville | January  | 13          |
    | Jacksonville | February | 23          |
    | Jacksonville | March    | 38          |
    | Jacksonville | April    | 5           |
    | Jacksonville | May      | 34          |
    | ElPaso       | January  | 20          |
    | ElPaso       | February | 6           |
    | ElPaso       | March    | 26          |
    | ElPaso       | April    | 2           |
    | ElPaso       | May      | 43          |
    +--------------+----------+-------------+
    **Output:**
    +----------+--------+--------------+
    | month    | ElPaso | Jacksonville |
    +----------+--------+--------------+
    | April    | 2      | 5            |
    | February | 6      | 23           |
    | January  | 20     | 13           |
    | March    | 26     | 38           |
    | May      | 43     | 34           |
    +----------+--------+--------------+
    **Explanation:** The table is pivoted, each column represents a city, and each row represents a specific month.

## Solution

```pythondata
import pandas as pd

def pivotTable(weather: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    result = weather.pivot(index='month', columns='city', values='temperature')
    result = result.sort_values(by='month')
    return result
```
