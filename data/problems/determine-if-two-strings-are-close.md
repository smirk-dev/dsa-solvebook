## Problem

Two strings are considered **close** if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:

  * Operation 1: Swap any two **existing** characters. 
    * For example, `a _b_ cd _e_ -> a _e_ cd _b_`
  * Operation 2: Transform **every** occurrence of one **existing** character into another **existing** character, and do the same with the other character. 
    * For example, `_aa_ c _abb_ -> _bb_ c _baa_` (all `a`'s turn into `b`'s, and all `b`'s turn into `a`'s)



You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.

Given two strings, `word1` and `word2`, return `true` _if_`word1` _and_`word2` _are**close** , and _`false` _otherwise._

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** word1 = "abc", word2 = "bca"
    **Output:** true
    **Explanation:** You can attain word2 from word1 in 2 operations.
    Apply Operation 1: "a _bc_ " -> "a _cb_ "
    Apply Operation 1: "_a_ c _b_ " -> "_b_ c _a_ "
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** word1 = "a", word2 = "aa"
    **Output:** false
    **Explanation:** It is impossible to attain word2 from word1, or vice versa, in any number of operations.
    

**Example 3:**
    
    
    **Input:** word1 = "cabbba", word2 = "abbccc"
    **Output:** true
    **Explanation:** You can attain word2 from word1 in 3 operations.
    Apply Operation 1: "ca _b_ bb _a_ " -> "ca _a_ bb _b_ "
    Apply Operation 2: "_c_ aa _bbb_ " -> "_b_ aa _ccc_ "
    Apply Operation 2: "_baa_ ccc" -> "_abb_ ccc"
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 105`
  * `word1` and `word2` contain only lowercase English letters.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def closeStrings(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> bool:
        from collections import Counter
        if len(word1) != len(word2):
            return False
        if set(word1) != set(word2):
            return False
        return sorted(Counter(word1).values()) == sorted(Counter(word2).values())
```
