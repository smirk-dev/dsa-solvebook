## Problem

A linked list of length `n` is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or `null`.

Construct a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly `n` **brand new** nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the `next` and `random` pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. **None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list**.

For example, if there are two nodes `X` and `Y` in the original list, where `X.random --> Y`, then for the corresponding two nodes `x` and `y` in the copied list, `x.random --> y`.

Return _the head of the copied linked list_.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of `n` nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:

  * `val`: an integer representing `Node.val`
  * `random_index`: the index of the node (range from `0` to `n-1`) that the `random` pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.



Your code will **only** be given the `head` of the original linked list.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
    **Output:** [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** head = [[1,1],[2,1]]
    **Output:** [[1,1],[2,1]]
    

**Example 3:**

****
    
    
    **Input:** head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
    **Output:** [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= n <= 1000`
  * `-104 <= Node.val <= 104`
  * `Node.random` is `null` or is pointing to some node in the linked list.

## Solution

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, next=None, random=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
        self.random = random

class Solution:
    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':
        if not head:
            return None
        old_to_new = {}
        curr = head
        # First pass: clone all nodes (without next and random)
        while curr:
            old_to_new[curr] = Node(curr.val)
            curr = curr.next
        curr = head
        # Second pass: set next and random pointers
        while curr:
            old_to_new[curr].next = old_to_new.get(curr.next)
            old_to_new[curr].random = old_to_new.get(curr.random)
            curr = curr.next
        return old_to_new[head]
```
