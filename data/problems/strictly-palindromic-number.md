## Problem

An integer `n` is **strictly palindromic** if, for **every** base `b` between `2` and `n - 2` (**inclusive**), the string representation of the integer `n` in base `b` is **palindromic**.

Given an integer `n`, return `true` _if_`n` _is**strictly palindromic** and _`false` _otherwise_.

A string is **palindromic** if it reads the same forward and backward.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** n = 9
    **Output:** false
    **Explanation:** In base 2: 9 = 1001 (base 2), which is palindromic.
    In base 3: 9 = 100 (base 3), which is not palindromic.
    Therefore, 9 is not strictly palindromic so we return false.
    Note that in bases 4, 5, 6, and 7, n = 9 is also not palindromic.
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** n = 4
    **Output:** false
    **Explanation:** We only consider base 2: 4 = 100 (base 2), which is not palindromic.
    Therefore, we return false.
    
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `4 <= n <= 105`

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isStrictlyPalindromic(int n) {
        return false;
    }
};
```
