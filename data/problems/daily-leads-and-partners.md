## Problem

Table: `DailySales`
    
    
    +-------------+---------+
    | Column Name | Type    |
    +-------------+---------+
    | date_id     | date    |
    | make_name   | varchar |
    | lead_id     | int     |
    | partner_id  | int     |
    +-------------+---------+
    There is no primary key (column with unique values) for this table. It may contain duplicates.
    This table contains the date and the name of the product sold and the IDs of the lead and partner it was sold to.
    The name consists of only lowercase English letters.
    

 

For each `date_id` and `make_name`, find the number of **distinct** `lead_id`'s and **distinct** `partner_id`'s.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** 
    DailySales table:
    +-----------+-----------+---------+------------+
    | date_id   | make_name | lead_id | partner_id |
    +-----------+-----------+---------+------------+
    | 2020-12-8 | toyota    | 0       | 1          |
    | 2020-12-8 | toyota    | 1       | 0          |
    | 2020-12-8 | toyota    | 1       | 2          |
    | 2020-12-7 | toyota    | 0       | 2          |
    | 2020-12-7 | toyota    | 0       | 1          |
    | 2020-12-8 | honda     | 1       | 2          |
    | 2020-12-8 | honda     | 2       | 1          |
    | 2020-12-7 | honda     | 0       | 1          |
    | 2020-12-7 | honda     | 1       | 2          |
    | 2020-12-7 | honda     | 2       | 1          |
    +-----------+-----------+---------+------------+
    **Output:** 
    +-----------+-----------+--------------+-----------------+
    | date_id   | make_name | unique_leads | unique_partners |
    +-----------+-----------+--------------+-----------------+
    | 2020-12-8 | toyota    | 2            | 3               |
    | 2020-12-7 | toyota    | 1            | 2               |
    | 2020-12-8 | honda     | 2            | 2               |
    | 2020-12-7 | honda     | 3            | 2               |
    +-----------+-----------+--------------+-----------------+
    **Explanation:** 
    For 2020-12-8, toyota gets leads = [0, 1] and partners = [0, 1, 2] while honda gets leads = [1, 2] and partners = [1, 2].
    For 2020-12-7, toyota gets leads = [0] and partners = [1, 2] while honda gets leads = [0, 1, 2] and partners = [1, 2].

## Solution

```pythondata
import pandas as pd

def daily_leads_and_partners(daily_sales: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    return daily_sales.groupby(
        by = ['date_id', 'make_name'],
        as_index = False
    ).agg(
        unique_leads = ("lead_id", "nunique"),
        unique_partners = ("partner_id", "nunique")
    )
```
