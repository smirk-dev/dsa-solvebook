## Problem

There is an **undirected** graph with `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` (**inclusive**). You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `values` where `values[i]` is the **value** of the `ith` node. You are also given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `edges`, where each `edges[j] = [uj, vj, timej]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between the nodes `uj` and `vj`, and it takes `timej` seconds to travel between the two nodes. Finally, you are given an integer `maxTime`.

A **valid** **path** in the graph is any path that starts at node `0`, ends at node `0`, and takes **at most** `maxTime` seconds to complete. You may visit the same node multiple times. The **quality** of a valid path is the **sum** of the values of the **unique nodes** visited in the path (each node's value is added **at most once** to the sum).

Return _the**maximum** quality of a valid path_.

**Note:** There are **at most four** edges connected to each node.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** values = [0,32,10,43], edges = [[0,1,10],[1,2,15],[0,3,10]], maxTime = 49
    **Output:** 75
    **Explanation:**
    One possible path is 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 3 -> 0. The total time taken is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 <= 49.
    The nodes visited are 0, 1, and 3, giving a maximal path quality of 0 + 32 + 43 = 75.
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** values = [5,10,15,20], edges = [[0,1,10],[1,2,10],[0,3,10]], maxTime = 30
    **Output:** 25
    **Explanation:**
    One possible path is 0 -> 3 -> 0. The total time taken is 10 + 10 = 20 <= 30.
    The nodes visited are 0 and 3, giving a maximal path quality of 5 + 20 = 25.
    

**Example 3:**
    
    
    **Input:** values = [1,2,3,4], edges = [[0,1,10],[1,2,11],[2,3,12],[1,3,13]], maxTime = 50
    **Output:** 7
    **Explanation:**
    One possible path is 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> 0. The total time taken is 10 + 13 + 13 + 10 = 46 <= 50.
    The nodes visited are 0, 1, and 3, giving a maximal path quality of 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `n == values.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 1000`
  * `0 <= values[i] <= 108`
  * `0 <= edges.length <= 2000`
  * `edges[j].length == 3 `
  * `0 <= uj < vj <= n - 1`
  * `10 <= timej, maxTime <= 100`
  * All the pairs `[uj, vj]` are **unique**.
  * There are **at most four** edges connected to each node.
  * The graph may not be connected.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maximalPathQuality(self, values: List[int], edges: List[List[int]], maxTime: int) -> int:
        from collections import defaultdict
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for u, v, t in edges:
            graph[u].append((v, t))
            graph[v].append((u, t))
        best = [0]
        def dfs(node, time_spent, cur_quality, seen):
            if time_spent > maxTime:
                return
            if node == 0:
                best[0] = max(best[0], cur_quality)
            for nei, t in graph[node]:
                add_val = 0 if nei in seen else values[nei]
                seen_added = False
                if nei not in seen:
                    seen.add(nei)
                    seen_added = True
                dfs(nei, time_spent + t, cur_quality + add_val, seen)
                if seen_added:
                    seen.remove(nei)
        dfs(0, 0, values[0], set([0]))
        return best[0]
```
