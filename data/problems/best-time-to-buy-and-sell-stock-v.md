## Problem

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a stock in dollars on the `ith` day, and an integer `k`.

You are allowed to make at most `k` transactions, where each transaction can be either of the following:

  * **Normal transaction** : Buy on day `i`, then sell on a later day `j` where `i < j`. You profit `prices[j] - prices[i]`.

  * **Short selling transaction** : Sell on day `i`, then buy back on a later day `j` where `i < j`. You profit `prices[i] - prices[j]`.




**Note** that you must complete each transaction before starting another. Additionally, you can't buy or sell on the same day you are selling or buying back as part of a previous transaction.

Return the **maximum** total profit you can earn by making **at most** `k` transactions.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = [1,7,9,8,2], k = 2

**Output:** 14

**Explanation:**

We can make $14 of profit through 2 transactions: 

  * A normal transaction: buy the stock on day 0 for $1 then sell it on day 2 for $9.
  * A short selling transaction: sell the stock on day 3 for $8 then buy back on day 4 for $2.



**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = [12,16,19,19,8,1,19,13,9], k = 3

**Output:** 36

**Explanation:**

We can make $36 of profit through 3 transactions: 

  * A normal transaction: buy the stock on day 0 for $12 then sell it on day 2 for $19.
  * A short selling transaction: sell the stock on day 3 for $19 then buy back on day 4 for $8.
  * A normal transaction: buy the stock on day 5 for $1 then sell it on day 6 for $19.



 

**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= prices.length <= 103`
  * `1 <= prices[i] <= 109`
  * `1 <= k <= prices.length / 2`

## Solution

```python
class Data:
    def __init__(self, profit, buy, sell):
        self.profit=profit
        self.buy=buy
        self.sell=sell
class Solution:
    def maximumProfit(self, prices: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        x0=prices[0]
        dp=[Data(0, -x0, x0) for _ in range(k+1)]
        n=len(prices)
        for i in range(1, n):
            x=prices[i]
            for t in range(k, 0, -1):
                cur=dp[t]
                prevP=dp[t-1].profit
                # close transaction t
                cur.profit=max(cur.profit, cur.buy+x, cur.sell-x)
                # open transaction t
                cur.buy=max(cur.buy,  prevP-x)
                cur.sell=max(cur.sell, prevP+x)
        return dp[-1].profit
```
