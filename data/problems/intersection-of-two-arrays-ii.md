## Problem

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return _an array of their intersection_. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in **any order**.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
    **Output:** [2,2]
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
    **Output:** [4,9]
    **Explanation:** [9,4] is also accepted.
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000`
  * `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000`



 

**Follow up:**

  * What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
  * What if `nums1`'s size is small compared to `nums2`'s size? Which algorithm is better?
  * What if elements of `nums2` are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] intersect(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int l1 = nums1.length;
        int l2 = nums2.length;
        int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;
        Arrays.sort(nums1);
        Arrays.sort(nums2);
        while( i < l1 && j < l2)
        {
            if(nums1[i] < nums2[j])
            {
                i++;
            }
            else if(nums1[i] > nums2[j])
            {
                j++;
            }
            else
            {
                nums1[k++] = nums1[i++];
                j++;
            }
        }
        return Arrays.copyOfRange(nums1,0,k);
    }
}
```
