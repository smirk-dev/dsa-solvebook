## Problem

You are given two **0-indexed** strings `source` and `target`, both of length `n` and consisting of **lowercase** English letters. You are also given two **0-indexed** character arrays `original` and `changed`, and an integer array `cost`, where `cost[i]` represents the cost of changing the character `original[i]` to the character `changed[i]`.

You start with the string `source`. In one operation, you can pick a character `x` from the string and change it to the character `y` at a cost of `z` **if** there exists **any** index `j` such that `cost[j] == z`, `original[j] == x`, and `changed[j] == y`.

Return _the**minimum** cost to convert the string _`source` _to the string_`target` _using**any** number of operations. If it is impossible to convert_ `source` _to_ `target`, _return_ `-1`.

**Note** that there may exist indices `i`, `j` such that `original[j] == original[i]` and `changed[j] == changed[i]`.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** source = "abcd", target = "acbe", original = ["a","b","c","c","e","d"], changed = ["b","c","b","e","b","e"], cost = [2,5,5,1,2,20]
    **Output:** 28
    **Explanation:** To convert the string "abcd" to string "acbe":
    - Change value at index 1 from 'b' to 'c' at a cost of 5.
    - Change value at index 2 from 'c' to 'e' at a cost of 1.
    - Change value at index 2 from 'e' to 'b' at a cost of 2.
    - Change value at index 3 from 'd' to 'e' at a cost of 20.
    The total cost incurred is 5 + 1 + 2 + 20 = 28.
    It can be shown that this is the minimum possible cost.
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** source = "aaaa", target = "bbbb", original = ["a","c"], changed = ["c","b"], cost = [1,2]
    **Output:** 12
    **Explanation:** To change the character 'a' to 'b' change the character 'a' to 'c' at a cost of 1, followed by changing the character 'c' to 'b' at a cost of 2, for a total cost of 1 + 2 = 3. To change all occurrences of 'a' to 'b', a total cost of 3 * 4 = 12 is incurred.
    

**Example 3:**
    
    
    **Input:** source = "abcd", target = "abce", original = ["a"], changed = ["e"], cost = [10000]
    **Output:** -1
    **Explanation:** It is impossible to convert source to target because the value at index 3 cannot be changed from 'd' to 'e'.
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= source.length == target.length <= 105`
  * `source`, `target` consist of lowercase English letters.
  * `1 <= cost.length == original.length == changed.length <= 2000`
  * `original[i]`, `changed[i]` are lowercase English letters.
  * `1 <= cost[i] <= 106`
  * `original[i] != changed[i]`

## Solution

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public long minimumCost(String source, String target, 
char[] original, char[] changed, int[] cost) {
        long[][] dist = new long[26][26];
        long INF = Long.MAX_VALUE / 2;

        for (long[] row : dist) {
            Arrays.fill(row, INF);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            dist[i][i] = 0;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < original.length; i++) {
            int u = original[i] - 'a';
            int v = changed[i] - 'a';
            dist[u][v] = Math.min(dist[u][v], cost[i]);
        }

        for (int k = 0; k < 26; k++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                if (dist[i][k] == INF) continue;
                for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++) {
                    if (dist[k][j] != INF) {
                        dist[i][j] = Math.min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        long totalCost = 0;
        int n = source.length();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int u = source.charAt(i) - 'a';
            int v = target.charAt(i) - 'a';
            if (u == v) continue;
            if (dist[u][v] == INF) return -1;
            totalCost += dist[u][v];
        }

        return totalCost;
    }
}
```
