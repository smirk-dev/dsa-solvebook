## Problem

A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top to represent the hours (0-11), and 6 LEDs on the bottom to represent the minutes (0-59). Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right.

  * For example, the below binary watch reads `"4:51"`.



Given an integer `turnedOn` which represents the number of LEDs that are currently on (ignoring the PM), return _all possible times the watch could represent_. You may return the answer in **any order**.

The hour must not contain a leading zero.

  * For example, `"01:00"` is not valid. It should be `"1:00"`.



The minute must consist of two digits and may contain a leading zero.

  * For example, `"10:2"` is not valid. It should be `"10:02"`.



 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** turnedOn = 1
    **Output:** ["0:01","0:02","0:04","0:08","0:16","0:32","1:00","2:00","4:00","8:00"]
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** turnedOn = 9
    **Output:** []
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= turnedOn <= 10`

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> readBinaryWatch(int k) {
        if (k == 0) return List.of("0:00");
        int mask = (1 << 6) - 1;
        int q = (1 << k) - 1;
        int limit = q << (10 - k);
        List<String> res = new ArrayList<>();

        while (q <= limit) {
            int min = q & mask;
            int hour = q >> 6;
            if (hour < 12 && min < 60)
                //res.add(String.format("%d:%02d", hour, min));
                res.add(hour + ":" + (min < 10 ? "0" : "") + min);
            int r = q & -q;
            int n = q + r;
            q = (((q ^ n) / r) >> 2) | n;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
