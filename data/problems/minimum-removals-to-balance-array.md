## Problem

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

An array is considered **balanced** if the value of its **maximum** element is **at most** `k` times the **minimum** element.

You may remove **any** number of elements from `nums`​​​​​​​ without making it **empty**.

Return the **minimum** number of elements to remove so that the remaining array is balanced.

**Note:** An array of size 1 is considered balanced as its maximum and minimum are equal, and the condition always holds true.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,1,5], k = 2

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

  * Remove `nums[2] = 5` to get `nums = [2, 1]`.
  * Now `max = 2`, `min = 1` and `max <= min * k` as `2 <= 1 * 2`. Thus, the answer is 1.



**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,6,2,9], k = 3

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

  * Remove `nums[0] = 1` and `nums[3] = 9` to get `nums = [6, 2]`.
  * Now `max = 6`, `min = 2` and `max <= min * k` as `6 <= 2 * 3`. Thus, the answer is 2.



**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [4,6], k = 2

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

  * Since `nums` is already balanced as `6 <= 4 * 2`, no elements need to be removed.



 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`
  * `1 <= k <= 105`

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int minRemoval(int[] nums, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int i = 0;
        int maxLen = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < nums.length; j++) {
            // Use long to prevent integer overflow for nums[i] * k
            while ((long) nums[j] > (long) nums[i] * k) {
                i++;
            }
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, j - i + 1);
        }
        return nums.length - maxLen;
    }
}
```
