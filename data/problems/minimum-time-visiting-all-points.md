## Problem

On a 2D plane, there are `n` points with integer coordinates `points[i] = [xi, yi]`. Return _the**minimum time** in seconds to visit all the points in the order given by _`points`.

You can move according to these rules:

  * In `1` second, you can either: 
    * move vertically by one unit,
    * move horizontally by one unit, or
    * move diagonally `sqrt(2)` units (in other words, move one unit vertically then one unit horizontally in `1` second).
  * You have to visit the points in the same order as they appear in the array.
  * You are allowed to pass through points that appear later in the order, but these do not count as visits.



 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** points = [[1,1],[3,4],[-1,0]]
    **Output:** 7
    **Explanation:** One optimal path is **[1,1]** -> [2,2] -> [3,3] -> **[3,4]** -> [2,3] -> [1,2] -> [0,1] -> **[-1,0]**   
    Time from [1,1] to [3,4] = 3 seconds 
    Time from [3,4] to [-1,0] = 4 seconds
    Total time = 7 seconds

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** points = [[3,2],[-2,2]]
    **Output:** 5
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `points.length == n`
  * `1 <= n <= 100`
  * `points[i].length == 2`
  * `-1000 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 1000`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def minTimeToVisitAllPoints(self, p: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        Ans = 0
        for i in range(1, len(p)):
            Ans += max(
                abs(p[i][0] - p[i - 1][0]),
                abs(p[i][1] - p[i - 1][1])
            )
        return Ans
```
