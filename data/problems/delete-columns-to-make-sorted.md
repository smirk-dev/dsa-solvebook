## Problem

You are given an array of `n` strings `strs`, all of the same length.

The strings can be arranged such that there is one on each line, making a grid.

  * For example, `strs = ["abc", "bce", "cae"]` can be arranged as follows:


    
    
    abc
    bce
    cae
    

You want to **delete** the columns that are **not sorted lexicographically**. In the above example (**0-indexed**), columns 0 (`'a'`, `'b'`, `'c'`) and 2 (`'c'`, `'e'`, `'e'`) are sorted, while column 1 (`'b'`, `'c'`, `'a'`) is not, so you would delete column 1.

Return _the number of columns that you will delete_.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** strs = ["cba","daf","ghi"]
    **Output:** 1
    **Explanation:** The grid looks as follows:
      cba
      daf
      ghi
    Columns 0 and 2 are sorted, but column 1 is not, so you only need to delete 1 column.
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** strs = ["a","b"]
    **Output:** 0
    **Explanation:** The grid looks as follows:
      a
      b
    Column 0 is the only column and is sorted, so you will not delete any columns.
    

**Example 3:**
    
    
    **Input:** strs = ["zyx","wvu","tsr"]
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** The grid looks as follows:
      zyx
      wvu
      tsr
    All 3 columns are not sorted, so you will delete all 3.
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `n == strs.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 100`
  * `1 <= strs[i].length <= 1000`
  * `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def minDeletionSize(self, strs: List[str]) -> int:
        res = 0
        for col in range(len(strs[0])):
            for row in range(1, len(strs)):
                if strs[row][col] < strs[row - 1][col]:
                    res += 1
                    break
        return res
```
