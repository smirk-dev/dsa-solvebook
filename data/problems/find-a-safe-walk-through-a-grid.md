## Problem

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid` and an integer `health`.

You start on the upper-left corner `(0, 0)` and would like to get to the lower-right corner `(m - 1, n - 1)`.

You can move up, down, left, or right from one cell to another adjacent cell as long as your health _remains_ **positive**.

Cells `(i, j)` with `grid[i][j] = 1` are considered **unsafe** and reduce your health by 1.

Return `true` if you can reach the final cell with a health value of 1 or more, and `false` otherwise.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = [[0,1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1,0]], health = 1

**Output:** true

**Explanation:**

The final cell can be reached safely by walking along the gray cells below.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = [[0,1,1,0,0,0],[1,0,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1,0,1],[0,0,1,0,1,0]], health = 3

**Output:** false

**Explanation:**

A minimum of 4 health points is needed to reach the final cell safely.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]], health = 5

**Output:** true

**Explanation:**

The final cell can be reached safely by walking along the gray cells below.

Any path that does not go through the cell `(1, 1)` is unsafe since your health will drop to 0 when reaching the final cell.

 

**Constraints:**

  * `m == grid.length`
  * `n == grid[i].length`
  * `1 <= m, n <= 50`
  * `2 <= m * n`
  * `1 <= health <= m + n`
  * `grid[i][j]` is either 0 or 1.

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean findSafeWalk(List<List<Integer>> grid, int health) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid.get(0).size();

        int[][] dist = new int[m][n];
        for (int[] row : dist)
            Arrays.fill(row, Integer.MAX_VALUE);

        Deque<int[]> dq = new ArrayDeque<>();

        dist[0][0] = grid.get(0).get(0);
        dq.offerFirst(new int[]{0, 0});

        int[] dx = {-1, 1, 0, 0};
        int[] dy = {0, 0, -1, 1};

        while (!dq.isEmpty()) {
            int[] curr = dq.pollFirst();
            int x = curr[0];
            int y = curr[1];

            if (x == m - 1 && y == n - 1)
                return dist[x][y] < health;

            for (int k = 0; k < 4; k++) {
                int nx = x + dx[k];
                int ny = y + dy[k];

                if (nx < 0 || nx >= m || ny < 0 || ny >= n)
                    continue;

                int w = grid.get(nx).get(ny);

                if (dist[x][y] + w < dist[nx][ny]) {
                    dist[nx][ny] = dist[x][y] + w;

                    if (w == 0)
                        dq.offerFirst(new int[]{nx, ny});
                    else
                        dq.offerLast(new int[]{nx, ny});
                }
            }
        }

        return dist[m - 1][n - 1] < health;
    }
}
```
