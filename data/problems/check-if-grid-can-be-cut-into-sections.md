## Problem

You are given an integer `n` representing the dimensions of an `n x n` grid, with the origin at the bottom-left corner of the grid. You are also given a 2D array of coordinates `rectangles`, where `rectangles[i]` is in the form `[startx, starty, endx, endy]`, representing a rectangle on the grid. Each rectangle is defined as follows:

  * `(startx, starty)`: The bottom-left corner of the rectangle.
  * `(endx, endy)`: The top-right corner of the rectangle.



**Note** that the rectangles do not overlap. Your task is to determine if it is possible to make **either two horizontal or two vertical cuts** on the grid such that:

  * Each of the three resulting sections formed by the cuts contains **at least** one rectangle.
  * Every rectangle belongs to **exactly** one section.



Return `true` if such cuts can be made; otherwise, return `false`.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5, rectangles = [[1,0,5,2],[0,2,2,4],[3,2,5,3],[0,4,4,5]]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:**

The grid is shown in the diagram. We can make horizontal cuts at `y = 2` and `y = 4`. Hence, output is true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 4, rectangles = [[0,0,1,1],[2,0,3,4],[0,2,2,3],[3,0,4,3]]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:**

We can make vertical cuts at `x = 2` and `x = 3`. Hence, output is true.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 4, rectangles = [[0,2,2,4],[1,0,3,2],[2,2,3,4],[3,0,4,2],[3,2,4,4]]

**Output:** false

**Explanation:**

We cannot make two horizontal or two vertical cuts that satisfy the conditions. Hence, output is false.

 

**Constraints:**

  * `3 <= n <= 109`
  * `3 <= rectangles.length <= 105`
  * `0 <= rectangles[i][0] < rectangles[i][2] <= n`
  * `0 <= rectangles[i][1] < rectangles[i][3] <= n`
  * No two rectangles overlap.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def checkValidCuts(self, n: int, rectangles: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        def check(intervals):
            intervals.sort()
            sections = 0
            max_end = intervals[0][1]
            for start, end in intervals:
                if max_end <= start:
                    sections += 1
                max_end = max(max_end, end)
            return sections >= 2
        x_intervals = [[rect[0], rect[2]] for rect in rectangles]
        y_intervals = [[rect[1], rect[3]] for rect in rectangles]
        return check(x_intervals) or check(y_intervals)
```
