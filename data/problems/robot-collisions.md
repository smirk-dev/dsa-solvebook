## Problem

There are `n` **1-indexed** robots, each having a position on a line, health, and movement direction.

You are given **0-indexed** integer arrays `positions`, `healths`, and a string `directions` (`directions[i]` is either **' L'** for **left** or **' R'** for **right**). All integers in `positions` are **unique**.

All robots start moving on the line**simultaneously** at the **same speed** in their given directions. If two robots ever share the same position while moving, they will **collide**.

If two robots collide, the robot with **lower health** is **removed** from the line, and the health of the other robot **decreases** **by one**. The surviving robot continues in the **same** direction it was going. If both robots have the **same** health, they are both**** removed from the line.

Your task is to determine the **health** of the robots that survive the collisions, in the same **order** that the robots were given,**** i.e. final health of robot 1 (if survived), final health of robot 2 (if survived), and so on. If there are no survivors, return an empty array.

Return _an array containing the health of the remaining robots (in the order they were given in the input), after no further collisions can occur._

**Note:** The positions may be unsorted.

 

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** positions = [5,4,3,2,1], healths = [2,17,9,15,10], directions = "RRRRR"
    **Output:** [2,17,9,15,10]
    **Explanation:** No collision occurs in this example, since all robots are moving in the same direction. So, the health of the robots in order from the first robot is returned, [2, 17, 9, 15, 10].
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** positions = [3,5,2,6], healths = [10,10,15,12], directions = "RLRL"
    **Output:** [14]
    **Explanation:** There are 2 collisions in this example. Firstly, robot 1 and robot 2 will collide, and since both have the same health, they will be removed from the line. Next, robot 3 and robot 4 will collide and since robot 4's health is smaller, it gets removed, and robot 3's health becomes 15 - 1 = 14. Only robot 3 remains, so we return [14].
    

**Example 3:**
    
    
    **Input:** positions = [1,2,5,6], healths = [10,10,11,11], directions = "RLRL"
    **Output:** []
    **Explanation:** Robot 1 and robot 2 will collide and since both have the same health, they are both removed. Robot 3 and 4 will collide and since both have the same health, they are both removed. So, we return an empty array, [].

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= positions.length == healths.length == directions.length == n <= 105`
  * `1 <= positions[i], healths[i] <= 109`
  * `directions[i] == 'L'` or `directions[i] == 'R'`
  * All values in `positions` are distinct

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> survivedRobotsHealths(int[] pos, int[] h, String d) {

        int n = pos.length;
        Integer[] order = new Integer[n];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) order[i]=i;

        Arrays.sort(order,(a,b)->pos[a]-pos[b]);

        boolean[] alive = new boolean[n];
        Arrays.fill(alive,true);

        Deque<Integer> st = new ArrayDeque<>();

        for(int idx:order){

            if(d.charAt(idx)=='R') st.push(idx);

            else{
                while(!st.isEmpty()){

                    int top = st.peek();

                    if(h[top] < h[idx]){
                        alive[top]=false;
                        st.pop();
                        h[idx]--;
                    }
                    else if(h[top] > h[idx]){
                        alive[idx]=false;
                        h[top]--;
                        break;
                    }
                    else{
                        alive[top]=false;
                        alive[idx]=false;
                        st.pop();
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        List<Integer> res=new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
            if(alive[i]) res.add(h[i]);

        return res;
    }
}
```
