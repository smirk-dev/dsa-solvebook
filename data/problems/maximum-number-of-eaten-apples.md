## Problem

There is a special kind of apple tree that grows apples every day for `n` days. On the `ith` day, the tree grows `apples[i]` apples that will rot after `days[i]` days, that is on day `i + days[i]` the apples will be rotten and cannot be eaten. On some days, the apple tree does not grow any apples, which are denoted by `apples[i] == 0` and `days[i] == 0`.

You decided to eat **at most** one apple a day (to keep the doctors away). Note that you can keep eating after the first `n` days.

Given two integer arrays `days` and `apples` of length `n`, return _the maximum number of apples you can eat._

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** apples = [1,2,3,5,2], days = [3,2,1,4,2]
    **Output:** 7
    **Explanation:** You can eat 7 apples:
    - On the first day, you eat an apple that grew on the first day.
    - On the second day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day.
    - On the third day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day. After this day, the apples that grew on the third day rot.
    - On the fourth to the seventh days, you eat apples that grew on the fourth day.
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** apples = [3,0,0,0,0,2], days = [3,0,0,0,0,2]
    **Output:** 5
    **Explanation:** You can eat 5 apples:
    - On the first to the third day you eat apples that grew on the first day.
    - Do nothing on the fouth and fifth days.
    - On the sixth and seventh days you eat apples that grew on the sixth day.
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `n == apples.length == days.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
  * `0 <= apples[i], days[i] <= 2 * 104`
  * `days[i] = 0` if and only if `apples[i] = 0`.

## Solution

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def eatenApples(self, apples: List[int], days: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(apples)
        heap = []  # min-heap storing (expiry_day, count)
        eaten = 0
        day = 0
        
        while day < n or heap:
            # Add apples grown on this day
            if day < n and apples[day] > 0:
                heapq.heappush(heap, (day + days[day], apples[day]))
            
            # Remove all rotten apples
            while heap and heap[0][0] <= day:
                heapq.heappop(heap)
            
            # Eat one apple from the batch that expires soonest
            if heap:
                expiry, count = heapq.heappop(heap)
                eaten += 1
                if count > 1:
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (expiry, count - 1))
            
            day += 1
        
        return eaten
```
