## Problem

There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct** values).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is **possibly left rotated** at an unknown index `k` (`1 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be left rotated by `3` indices and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Given the array `nums` **after** the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return _the index of_`target` _if it is in_`nums` _, or_`-1` _if it is not in_`nums`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
    **Output:** 4
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
    **Output:** -1
    

**Example 3:**
    
    
    **Input:** nums = [1], target = 0
    **Output:** -1
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
  * `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
  * All values of `nums` are **unique**.
  * `nums` is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
  * `-104 <= target <= 104`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            # Left side is sorted
            if nums[left] <= nums[mid]:
                if nums[left] <= target < nums[mid]:
                    right = mid - 1
                else:
                    left = mid + 1
            # Right side is sorted
            else:
                if nums[mid] < target <= nums[right]:
                    left = mid + 1
                else:
                    right = mid - 1
        return -1
```
