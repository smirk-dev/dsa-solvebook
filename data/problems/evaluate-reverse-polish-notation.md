## Problem

You are given an array of strings `tokens` that represents an arithmetic expression in a [Reverse Polish Notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).

Evaluate the expression. Return _an integer that represents the value of the expression_.

**Note** that:

  * The valid operators are `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, and `'/'`.
  * Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
  * The division between two integers always **truncates toward zero**.
  * There will not be any division by zero.
  * The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.
  * The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a **32-bit** integer.



 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]
    **Output:** 9
    **Explanation:** ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]
    **Output:** 6
    **Explanation:** (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6
    

**Example 3:**
    
    
    **Input:** tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]
    **Output:** 22
    **Explanation:** ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
    = ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
    = ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
    = ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
    = (0 + 17) + 5
    = 17 + 5
    = 22
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= tokens.length <= 104`
  * `tokens[i]` is either an operator: `"+"`, `"-"`, `"*"`, or `"/"`, or an integer in the range `[-200, 200]`.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def evalRPN(self, tokens: List[str]) -> int:
        stack = []
        for token in tokens:
            if token in {"+", "-", "*", "/"}:
                b = stack.pop()
                a = stack.pop()
                if token == "+":
                    stack.append(a + b)
                elif token == "-":
                    stack.append(a - b)
                elif token == "*":
                    stack.append(a * b)
                else:  # Division
                    # Integer division that truncates toward zero
                    stack.append(int(a / b))
            else:
                stack.append(int(token))
        return stack[0]
```
