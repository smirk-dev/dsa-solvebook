## Problem

**No-Zero integer** is a positive integer that **does not contain any`0`** in its decimal representation.

Given an integer `n`, return _a list of two integers_ `[a, b]` _where_ :

  * `a` and `b` are **No-Zero integers**.
  * `a + b = n`



The test cases are generated so that there is at least one valid solution. If there are many valid solutions, you can return any of them.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** n = 2
    **Output:** [1,1]
    **Explanation:** Let a = 1 and b = 1.
    Both a and b are no-zero integers, and a + b = 2 = n.
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** n = 11
    **Output:** [2,9]
    **Explanation:** Let a = 2 and b = 9.
    Both a and b are no-zero integers, and a + b = 11 = n.
    Note that there are other valid answers as [8, 3] that can be accepted.
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= n <= 104`

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> getNoZeroIntegers(int n) {
        int a=0, b= 0, tens=1;
        for (; n>0; n/=10, tens*=10) {
            int d=n%10;
            if (d==0) {
                // borrow from next higher digit: 5+5
                a+=5*tens;
                b+=5*tens;
                n-=10;  // subtract from the next digit
            } 
            else if (d==1 && n>=10) {
                a+=6*tens;
                b+=5*tens;
                n-=10;  // borrow
            } 
            else {
                // normal split
                a+=(d-d/2)*tens;
                b+=(d/2)*tens;
            }
        }
        return {a, b};
    }
};
```
