## Problem

A `3 x 3` **magic square** is a `3 x 3` grid filled with distinct numbers **from** 1**to** 9 such that each row, column, and both diagonals all have the same sum.

Given a `row x col` `grid` of integers, how many `3 x 3` magic square subgrids are there?

Note: while a magic square can only contain numbers from 1 to 9, `grid` may contain numbers up to 15.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** grid = [[4,3,8,4],[9,5,1,9],[2,7,6,2]]
    **Output:** 1
    **Explanation:**
    The following subgrid is a 3 x 3 magic square:
    
    while this one is not:
    
    In total, there is only one magic square inside the given grid.
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** grid = [[8]]
    **Output:** 0
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `row == grid.length`
  * `col == grid[i].length`
  * `1 <= row, col <= 10`
  * `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 15`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def numMagicSquaresInside(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        r, c = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        if r < 3 or c < 3:
            return 0
        ans = 0
        for i in range(r - 2):
            for j in range(c - 2):
                used = [False] * 10
                ok = True
                for x in range(3):
                    for y in range(3):
                        v = grid[i + x][j + y]
                        if v < 1 or v > 9 or used[v]:
                            ok = False
                            break
                        used[v] = True
                    if not ok:
                        break
                if not ok:
                    continue
                s = grid[i][j] + grid[i][j+1] + grid[i][j+2]
                for x in range(3):
                    if grid[i+x][j] + grid[i+x][j+1] + grid[i+x][j+2] != s:
                        ok = False
                for y in range(3):
                    if grid[i][j+y] + grid[i+1][j+y] + grid[i+2][j+y] != s:
                        ok = False
                if grid[i][j] + grid[i+1][j+1] + grid[i+2][j+2] != s:
                    ok = False
                if grid[i][j+2] + grid[i+1][j+1] + grid[i+2][j] != s:
                    ok = False
                if ok:
                    ans += 1
        return ans
```
