## Problem

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return _the reordered list_.

The **first** node is considered **odd** , and the **second** node is **even** , and so on.

Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

You must solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` time complexity.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5]
    **Output:** [1,3,5,2,4]
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
    **Output:** [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
  * `-106 <= Node.val <= 106`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def oddEvenList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        odd = head
        even = head.next
        even_head = even
        while even and even.next:
            odd.next = even.next
            odd = odd.next
            even.next = odd.next
            even = even.next
        odd.next = even_head
        return head
```

## Editorial

_Add your notes here — why did you choose this approach? What's the time/space complexity?_
