## Problem

You are **building** a string `s` of length `n` **one** character at a time, **prepending** each new character to the **front** of the string. The strings are labeled from `1` to `n`, where the string with length `i` is labeled `si`.

  * For example, for `s = "abaca"`, `s1 == "a"`, `s2 == "ca"`, `s3 == "aca"`, etc.



The **score** of `si` is the length of the **longest common prefix** between `si` and `sn` (Note that `s == sn`).

Given the final string `s`, return _the**sum** of the **score** of every _`si`.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** s = "babab"
    **Output:** 9
    **Explanation:**
    For s1 == "b", the longest common prefix is "b" which has a score of 1.
    For s2 == "ab", there is no common prefix so the score is 0.
    For s3 == "bab", the longest common prefix is "bab" which has a score of 3.
    For s4 == "abab", there is no common prefix so the score is 0.
    For s5 == "babab", the longest common prefix is "babab" which has a score of 5.
    The sum of the scores is 1 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 5 = 9, so we return 9.

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** s = "azbazbzaz"
    **Output:** 14
    **Explanation:** 
    For s2 == "az", the longest common prefix is "az" which has a score of 2.
    For s6 == "azbzaz", the longest common prefix is "azb" which has a score of 3.
    For s9 == "azbazbzaz", the longest common prefix is "azbazbzaz" which has a score of 9.
    For all other si, the score is 0.
    The sum of the scores is 2 + 3 + 9 = 14, so we return 14.
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def sumScores(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        z = [0] * n
        l = r = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            if i <= r:
                z[i] = min(r - i + 1, z[i - l])
            while i + z[i] < n and s[z[i]] == s[i + z[i]]:
                z[i] += 1
            if i + z[i] - 1 > r:
                l, r = i, i + z[i] - 1
        return sum(z) + n
```
