## Problem

You are given an `n x n` square matrix of integers `grid`. Return the matrix such that:

  * The diagonals in the **bottom-left triangle** (including the middle diagonal) are sorted in **non-increasing order**.
  * The diagonals in the **top-right triangle** are sorted in **non-decreasing order**.



 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,7,3],[9,8,2],[4,5,6]]

**Output:** [[8,2,3],[9,6,7],[4,5,1]]

**Explanation:**

The diagonals with a black arrow (bottom-left triangle) should be sorted in non-increasing order:

  * `[1, 8, 6]` becomes `[8, 6, 1]`.
  * `[9, 5]` and `[4]` remain unchanged.



The diagonals with a blue arrow (top-right triangle) should be sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * `[7, 2]` becomes `[2, 7]`.
  * `[3]` remains unchanged.



**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = [[0,1],[1,2]]

**Output:** [[2,1],[1,0]]

**Explanation:**

The diagonals with a black arrow must be non-increasing, so `[0, 2]` is changed to `[2, 0]`. The other diagonals are already in the correct order.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** grid = [[1]]

**Output:** [[1]]

**Explanation:**

Diagonals with exactly one element are already in order, so no changes are needed.

 

**Constraints:**

  * `grid.length == grid[i].length == n`
  * `1 <= n <= 10`
  * `-105 <= grid[i][j] <= 105`

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> sortMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size(), m = grid[0].size();
        unordered_map<int, priority_queue<int>> maxHeaps;
        unordered_map<int, priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>>> minHeaps;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                int key = i - j;
                if (key < 0) minHeaps[key].push(grid[i][j]);
                else maxHeaps[key].push(grid[i][j]);
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                int key = i - j;
                if (key < 0) {
                    grid[i][j] = minHeaps[key].top();
                    minHeaps[key].pop();
                } else {
                    grid[i][j] = maxHeaps[key].top();
                    maxHeaps[key].pop();
                }
            }
        }
        return grid;
    }
};
```
