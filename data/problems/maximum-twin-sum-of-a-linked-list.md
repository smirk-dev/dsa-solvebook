## Problem

In a linked list of size `n`, where `n` is **even** , the `ith` node (**0-indexed**) of the linked list is known as the **twin** of the `(n-1-i)th` node, if `0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1`.

  * For example, if `n = 4`, then node `0` is the twin of node `3`, and node `1` is the twin of node `2`. These are the only nodes with twins for `n = 4`.



The **twin sum** is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.

Given the `head` of a linked list with even length, return _the**maximum twin sum** of the linked list_.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** head = [5,4,2,1]
    **Output:** 6
    **Explanation:**
    Nodes 0 and 1 are the twins of nodes 3 and 2, respectively. All have twin sum = 6.
    There are no other nodes with twins in the linked list.
    Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is 6. 
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** head = [4,2,2,3]
    **Output:** 7
    **Explanation:**
    The nodes with twins present in this linked list are:
    - Node 0 is the twin of node 3 having a twin sum of 4 + 3 = 7.
    - Node 1 is the twin of node 2 having a twin sum of 2 + 2 = 4.
    Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is max(7, 4) = 7. 
    

**Example 3:**
    
    
    **Input:** head = [1,100000]
    **Output:** 100001
    **Explanation:**
    There is only one node with a twin in the linked list having twin sum of 1 + 100000 = 100001.
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in the list is an **even** integer in the range `[2, 105]`.
  * `1 <= Node.val <= 105`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def pairSum(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> int:
        slow = head
        fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        prev = None
        while slow:
            next_node = slow.next
            slow.next = prev
            prev = slow
            slow = next_node
        max_sum = 0
        first = head
        second = prev
        while second:
            max_sum = max(max_sum, first.val + second.val)
            first = first.next
            second = second.next
        return max_sum
```
