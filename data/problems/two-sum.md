## Problem

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to`target`_.

You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_ one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
    **Output:** [0,1]
    **Explanation:** Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
    **Output:** [1,2]
    

**Example 3:**
    
    
    **Input:** nums = [3,3], target = 6
    **Output:** [0,1]
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
  * `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
  * `-109 <= target <= 109`
  * **Only one valid answer exists.**



 

**Follow-up:  **Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than `O(n2)` time complexity?

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        num_to_index = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            complement = target - num
            if complement in num_to_index:
                return [num_to_index[complement], i]
            num_to_index[num] = i
```

## Editorial

_Add your notes here — why did you choose this approach? What's the time/space complexity?_
