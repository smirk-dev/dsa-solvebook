## Problem

Table: `Person`
    
    
    +-------------+---------+
    | Column Name | Type    |
    +-------------+---------+
    | id          | int     |
    | email       | varchar |
    +-------------+---------+
    id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
    Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
    

 

Write a solution to**delete** all duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest `id`.

For SQL users, please note that you are supposed to write a `DELETE` statement and not a `SELECT` one.

For Pandas users, please note that you are supposed to modify `Person` in place.

After running your script, the answer shown is the `Person` table. The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the `Person` table. The final order of the `Person` table **does not matter**.

The result format is in the following example.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** 
    Person table:
    +----+------------------+
    | id | email            |
    +----+------------------+
    | 1  | john@example.com |
    | 2  | bob@example.com  |
    | 3  | john@example.com |
    +----+------------------+
    **Output:** 
    +----+------------------+
    | id | email            |
    +----+------------------+
    | 1  | john@example.com |
    | 2  | bob@example.com  |
    +----+------------------+
    **Explanation:** john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.

## Solution

```pythondata
import pandas as pd

# Modify Person in place
def delete_duplicate_emails(person: pd.DataFrame) -> None:
    # Sort the rows based on id (Ascending order)
    person.sort_values(by='id',ascending=True,inplace=True)
    # Drop the duplicates based on email.
    person.drop_duplicates(subset='email', keep='first', inplace=True)
```
