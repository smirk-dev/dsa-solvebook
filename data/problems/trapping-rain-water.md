## Problem

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
    **Output:** 6
    **Explanation:** The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
    **Output:** 9
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `n == height.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
  * `0 <= height[i] <= 105`

## Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def trap(self, height):
        left = 0
        right = len(height) - 1
        left_max = height[left]
        right_max = height[right]
        water = 0

        while left < right:
            if left_max < right_max:
                left += 1
                left_max = max(left_max, height[left])
                water += left_max - height[left]
            else:
                right -= 1
                right_max = max(right_max, height[right])
                water += right_max - height[right]
        
        return water
```
