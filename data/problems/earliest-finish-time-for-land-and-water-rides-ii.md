## Problem

You are given two categories of theme park attractions: **land rides** and **water rides**.

  * **Land rides**
    * `landStartTime[i]` - the earliest time the `ith` land ride can be boarded.
    * `landDuration[i]` - how long the `ith` land ride lasts.
  * **Water rides**
    * `waterStartTime[j]` - the earliest time the `jth` water ride can be boarded.
    * `waterDuration[j]` - how long the `jth` water ride lasts.



A tourist must experience **exactly one** ride from **each** category, in **either order**.

  * A ride may be started at its opening time or **any later moment**.
  * If a ride is started at time `t`, it finishes at time `t + duration`.
  * Immediately after finishing one ride the tourist may board the other (if it is already open) or wait until it opens.



Return the **earliest possible time** at which the tourist can finish both rides.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** landStartTime = [2,8], landDuration = [4,1], waterStartTime = [6], waterDuration = [3]

**Output:** 9

**Explanation:** ​​​​​​​

  * Plan A (land ride 0 -> water ride 0): 
    * Start land ride 0 at time `landStartTime[0] = 2`. Finish at `2 + landDuration[0] = 6`.
    * Water ride 0 opens at time `waterStartTime[0] = 6`. Start immediately at `6`, finish at `6 + waterDuration[0] = 9`.
  * Plan B (water ride 0 -> land ride 1): 
    * Start water ride 0 at time `waterStartTime[0] = 6`. Finish at `6 + waterDuration[0] = 9`.
    * Land ride 1 opens at `landStartTime[1] = 8`. Start at time `9`, finish at `9 + landDuration[1] = 10`.
  * Plan C (land ride 1 -> water ride 0): 
    * Start land ride 1 at time `landStartTime[1] = 8`. Finish at `8 + landDuration[1] = 9`.
    * Water ride 0 opened at `waterStartTime[0] = 6`. Start at time `9`, finish at `9 + waterDuration[0] = 12`.
  * Plan D (water ride 0 -> land ride 0): 
    * Start water ride 0 at time `waterStartTime[0] = 6`. Finish at `6 + waterDuration[0] = 9`.
    * Land ride 0 opened at `landStartTime[0] = 2`. Start at time `9`, finish at `9 + landDuration[0] = 13`.



Plan A gives the earliest finish time of 9.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** landStartTime = [5], landDuration = [3], waterStartTime = [1], waterDuration = [10]

**Output:** 14

**Explanation:** ​​​​​​​

  * Plan A (water ride 0 -> land ride 0): 
    * Start water ride 0 at time `waterStartTime[0] = 1`. Finish at `1 + waterDuration[0] = 11`.
    * Land ride 0 opened at `landStartTime[0] = 5`. Start immediately at `11` and finish at `11 + landDuration[0] = 14`.
  * Plan B (land ride 0 -> water ride 0): 
    * Start land ride 0 at time `landStartTime[0] = 5`. Finish at `5 + landDuration[0] = 8`.
    * Water ride 0 opened at `waterStartTime[0] = 1`. Start immediately at `8` and finish at `8 + waterDuration[0] = 18`.



Plan A provides the earliest finish time of 14.**​​​​​​​**

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n, m <= 5 * 104`
  * `landStartTime.length == landDuration.length == n`
  * `waterStartTime.length == waterDuration.length == m`
  * `1 <= landStartTime[i], landDuration[i], waterStartTime[j], waterDuration[j] <= 105`

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    final static int MAX = 300005;

    public int earliestFinishTime(int[] la, int[] lb, int[] wa, int[] wb) {
        int l = MAX, w = MAX, minL = MAX, minW = MAX;
        int n = la.length, m = wa.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            l = Math.min(l, la[i] + lb[i]);

        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            w = Math.min(w, wa[i] + wb[i]);
            minL = Math.min(minL, Math.max(wa[i], l) + wb[i]);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            minW = Math.min(minW, Math.max(la[i], w) + lb[i]);

        return Math.min(minW, minL);
    }
}
```
