## Problem

Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive.

There is only **one repeated number** in `nums`, return _this  repeated number_.

You must solve the problem **without** modifying the array `nums` and using only constant extra space.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
    **Output:** 2
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
    **Output:** 3
    

**Example 3:**
    
    
    **Input:** nums = [3,3,3,3,3]
    **Output:** 3

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 105`
  * `nums.length == n + 1`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= n`
  * All the integers in `nums` appear only **once** except for **precisely one integer** which appears **two or more** times.



 

**Follow up:**

  * How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in `nums`?
  * Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        slow = nums[0]
        fast = nums[0]
        
        while True:
            slow = nums[slow]
            fast = nums[nums[fast]]
            if slow == fast:
                break
        
        slow2 = nums[0]
        while slow != slow2:
            slow = nums[slow]
            slow2 = nums[slow2]

        return slow
```

_Add your notes here — why did you choose this approach? What's the time/space complexity?_
