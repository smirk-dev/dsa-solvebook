## Problem

Given a binary string `s`, return the number of non-empty substrings that have the same number of `0`'s and `1`'s, and all the `0`'s and all the `1`'s in these substrings are grouped consecutively.

Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** s = "00110011"
    **Output:** 6
    **Explanation:** There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".
    Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.
    Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** s = "10101"
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** There are 4 substrings: "10", "01", "10", "01" that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's.
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int countBinarySubstrings(String s) {
        int res = 0, prev = 0, strk = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i - 1)) strk++;
            else {
                prev = strk;
                strk = 1;
            }
            if (strk <= prev) res++;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
