## Problem

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return _the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence._

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
    **Output:** 9
    

**Example 3:**
    
    
    **Input:** nums = [1,0,1,2]
    **Output:** 3
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        num_set = set(nums)
        longest = 0
        for num in num_set:
            if num - 1 not in num_set:
                current = num
                streak = 1
                while current + 1 in num_set:
                    current += 1
                    streak += 1
                longest = max(longest, streak)
        return longest
```

## Editorial

_Add your notes here — why did you choose this approach? What's the time/space complexity?_
