## Problem

You are given a binary matrix `matrix` of size `m x n`, and you are allowed to rearrange the **columns** of the `matrix` in any order.

Return _the area of the largest submatrix within_`matrix` _where**every** element of the submatrix is _`1` _after reordering the columns optimally._

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** matrix = [[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[1,0,1]]
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** You can rearrange the columns as shown above.
    The largest submatrix of 1s, in bold, has an area of 4.
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** matrix = [[1,0,1,0,1]]
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** You can rearrange the columns as shown above.
    The largest submatrix of 1s, in bold, has an area of 3.
    

**Example 3:**
    
    
    **Input:** matrix = [[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** Notice that you must rearrange entire columns, and there is no way to make a submatrix of 1s larger than an area of 2.
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `m == matrix.length`
  * `n == matrix[i].length`
  * `1 <= m * n <= 105`
  * `matrix[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int largestSubmatrix(int[][] matrix) {
        int m = matrix.length, n = matrix[0].length;
        int res = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                if (matrix[i][j] == 1)
                    matrix[i][j] += matrix[i - 1][j];

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            Arrays.sort(matrix[i]);
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                res = Math.max(res, matrix[i][j] * (n - j));
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```
