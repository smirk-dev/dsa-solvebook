## Problem

You are given the `root` of a binary tree where each node has a value `0` or `1`. Each root-to-leaf path represents a binary number starting with the most significant bit.

  * For example, if the path is `0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1`, then this could represent `01101` in binary, which is `13`.



For all leaves in the tree, consider the numbers represented by the path from the root to that leaf. Return _the sum of these numbers_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a **32-bits** integer.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** root = [1,0,1,0,1,0,1]
    **Output:** 22
    **Explanation:**(100) + (101) + (110) + (111) = 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** root = [0]
    **Output:** 0
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
  * `Node.val` is `0` or `1`.

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int sumRootToLeaf(TreeNode root) {
        return DFS(root, 0);
    }

    public int DFS(TreeNode rt, int x) {
        if (rt==null) return 0;
        x = x*2 + rt.val;
        if(rt.left==rt.right) return x;
        return DFS(rt.left, x) + DFS(rt.right, x);
    }
}
```
