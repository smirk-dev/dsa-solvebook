## Problem

Given two promises `promise1` and `promise2`, return a new promise. `promise1` and `promise2` will both resolve with a number. The returned promise should resolve with the sum of the two numbers. 

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** 
    promise1 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(2), 20)), 
    promise2 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(5), 60))
    **Output:** 7
    **Explanation:** The two input promises resolve with the values of 2 and 5 respectively. The returned promise should resolve with a value of 2 + 5 = 7. The time the returned promise resolves is not judged for this problem.
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** 
    promise1 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(10), 50)), 
    promise2 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(-12), 30))
    **Output:** -2
    **Explanation:** The two input promises resolve with the values of 10 and -12 respectively. The returned promise should resolve with a value of 10 + -12 = -2.
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `promise1` and `promise2` are promises that resolve with a number

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {Promise} promise1
 * @param {Promise} promise2
 * @return {Promise}
 */
var addTwoPromises = async function(promise1, promise2) {
  // Wait for both promises to resolve and retrieve their values
  const [value1, value2] = await Promise.all([promise1, promise2]);

  // Return a new promise that resolves with the sum of the values
  return value1 + value2;
};

// // Example usage:
// var promise1 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(2), 20));
// var promise2 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(5), 60));

// addTwoPromises(promise1, promise2)
//   .then(console.log); // Output: 7
```
