## Problem

You have a `grid` of size `n x 3` and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colors: **Red** , **Yellow,** or **Green** while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same color (i.e., no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same color).

Given `n` the number of rows of the grid, return _the number of ways_ you can paint this `grid`. As the answer may grow large, the answer **must be** computed modulo `109 + 7`.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** n = 1
    **Output:** 12
    **Explanation:** There are 12 possible way to paint the grid as shown.
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** n = 5000
    **Output:** 30228214
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `n == grid.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 5000`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def numOfWays(self, n: int) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        A = B = 6
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            A, B = (2*A + 2*B) % MOD, (2*A + 3*B) % MOD
        return (A + B) % MOD
```
