## Problem

You are given a 2D matrix `grid` of size `n x n`. Initially, all cells of the grid are colored white. In one operation, you can select any cell of indices `(i, j)`, and color black all the cells of the `jth` column starting from the top row down to the `ith` row.

The grid score is the sum of all `grid[i][j]` such that cell `(i, j)` is white and it has a horizontally adjacent black cell.

Return the **maximum** score that can be achieved after some number of operations.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = [[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,3,0,0],[0,1,0,0,0],[5,0,0,3,0],[0,0,0,0,2]]

**Output:** 11

**Explanation:**

In the first operation, we color all cells in column 1 down to row 3, and in the second operation, we color all cells in column 4 down to the last row. The score of the resulting grid is `grid[3][0] + grid[1][2] + grid[3][3]` which is equal to 11.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = [[10,9,0,0,15],[7,1,0,8,0],[5,20,0,11,0],[0,0,0,1,2],[8,12,1,10,3]]

**Output:** 94

**Explanation:**

We perform operations on 1, 2, and 3 down to rows 1, 4, and 0, respectively. The score of the resulting grid is `grid[0][0] + grid[1][0] + grid[2][1] + grid[4][1] + grid[1][3] + grid[2][3] + grid[3][3] + grid[4][3] + grid[0][4]` which is equal to 94.

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n == grid.length <= 100`
  * `n == grid[i].length`
  * `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 109`

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public long maximumScore(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        if (n == 1) 
            return 0;
        long[] dp0 = new long[n + 1];
        long[] dp1 = new long[n + 1];
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            long[] new_dp0 = new long[n + 1];
            long[] new_dp1 = new long[n + 1];
            for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
                long prev = 0, curr = 0;
                for (int x = 0; x < i; x++)
                    curr += grid[x][j];
                for (int y = 0; y <= n; y++) {
                    if (y > 0 && y <= i)
                        curr -= grid[y - 1][j];
                    if (y > i)
                        prev += grid[y - 1][j - 1];
                    new_dp0[y] = Math.max(new_dp0[y], Math.max(prev + dp0[i], dp1[i]));
                    new_dp1[y] = Math.max(new_dp1[y], Math.max(curr + dp1[i], curr + prev + dp0[i]));
                }
            }
            dp0 = new_dp0;
            dp1 = new_dp1;
        }
        long res = 0;
        for (long v : dp1) 
            res = Math.max(res, v);
        return res;
    }
}
```
